* So...
* You finally did it.
* You killed me.
* Heh.
* And here I was thinking you could change...
* Guess I was wrong.
* ...
* No.
* I'm not going to die, not by your hands.
* You know why?
* 'cause unlike you, I have a reason, a reason to keep going.
* Everyone's counting on me.
* I'm filled with DETERMINATION.
